## SandSnap now!  
To take the best image:

Go to a dry part of the sandy beach that is clear of debris such as shells, sticks, etc.  
Place a US coin on the sand.   
Snap a picture! Set your focus on the sand, not the coin and avoid shadows.   
Upload your picture to this website. Your picture should look like the image above.  
PHOTO TIPS: Make sure to tap on your phone screen for the image to focus on the sand and not the coin. Try to keep your shadow out of the image.
