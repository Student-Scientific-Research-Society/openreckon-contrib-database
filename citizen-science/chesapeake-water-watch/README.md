The Chesapeake Water Watch is a joint project between the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) and the City College of New York (CCNY). Our researchers are developing new ways to use remote sensing to fill in water monitoring gaps. We're testing these tools in our backyard - the Chesapeake Bay, aka our nation's largest estuary. We are partnering with Riverkeepers and individuals like you to collect data with simple-to-use scientific equipment and smartphone applications. These measurements collected by people on the ground will be used by researchers to help "train" the satellites to accurately monitor the Bay.  

The project results will not only help us monitor the health of the Chesapeake Bay, but will lead to better tools by which to monitor coastal waters around the world!

Chesapeake Water Watch is made possible by the NASA Citizen Science for Earth Systems Program (CSESP). Find out more about citizen science and volunteering at NASA.
