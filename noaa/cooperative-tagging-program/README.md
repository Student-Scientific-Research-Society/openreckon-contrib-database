# Cooperative Tagging Program  
We distribute fish tags to anglers who regularly catch and release billfish, tuna, and swordfish. Our program is a community science effort that depends heavily on volunteers who are frequently out on the water.  

Southeast Fisheries Science Center’s Cooperative Tagging Program relies on information collected by volunteers—charter captains, anglers, and commercial fishermen—who are frequently out on the water. Volunteers not only tag and release billfish (sailfish and marlin), tuna, and swordfish, but also report when they have recaptured one. By recording interactions with tagged fish, scientists are learning more about when and where the fish migrate and the range of their habitat. They also learn seasonal patterns, shifts in behavioral changes, and other aspects of their ecology, as well as post-release survival. All of this information leads to a more sustainably managed fishery.   

Are you a recreational angler in the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or Caribbean that targets blue-water species and occasionally releases billfish or tuna? Then you can be a volunteer of the program by getting a free tagging kit that comes with the directions on how to successfully be a part of the program.  

## Fishing For Data  

### Free Tagging Kits  
All volunteers first need a tagging kit. Each kit has instructions on tagging procedures, best practices for fish handling, and how to report needed information if you catch a tagged fish.  

To request a free tagging kit, email tagging@noaa.gov or call (800) 437-3936.  

## When Tagging a Fish  
### Untagged Fish:  
1. Have a tag ready to attach to the fish you plan to release. Handle the fish as carefully as possible.  
2. Verify that the tag number matches the number printed on the Fish Tagging Report associated with the tag.  
3. Record the length and weight of the fish.  
4. Record the date and the catch location as precisely as possible.  
5. Tag the fish and ensure the tag is secure. If the fish is not lively, revive it as long as possible by pulling it alongside the boat to pass water over its gills before release.  
### Recaptured fish with a tag:  
1. Check every fish you catch for a tag–they can easily be missed.  
2. Carefully record the tag number that is printed on the tag. If possible, take a picture with the tag number visible, and note any contact information.  
3. If the printing on the tag is illegible or if the situation does not allow for easy viewing, remove and retain the tag. Re-tag the fish with a new tag, making a note of the old tag number on the new Fish Tagging Report. Do not attach the old tag to the new Fish Tagging Report.  
4. Send the old tag into our team for confirmation of number and species.  
5. Record the length and weight of the fish.  
6. Record the date and the catch location as precisely as possible.   
7. Tag the fish and ensure the tag is secure. If the fish is not lively, revive it as long as possible by pulling it alongside the boat to pass water over its gills before release.
