Exoplanet Watch is a NASA citizen science project, sponsored by NASA's Universe of Learning, that lets anyone and everyone (yes, you!) learn about planets that orbit stars beyond our solar system and get involved in observing them.  

## What is an exoplanet?  
An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system. Most exoplanets orbit other stars. Transiting exoplanets pass in front of, or transit, the stars they orbit as seen from an observer's perspective.
