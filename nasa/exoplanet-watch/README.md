Exoplanet Watch is a NASA citizen science project, sponsored by NASA's Universe of Learning, that lets anyone and everyone (yes, you!) learn about planets that orbit stars beyond our solar system and get involved in observing them.  

## What is an exoplanet?  
An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system. Most exoplanets orbit other stars. Transiting exoplanets pass in front of, or transit, the stars they orbit as seen from an observer's perspective.  

When you look up into the night sky, do you wonder what's out there beyond our solar system? So do we! Come join us in learning more about exoplanets, the worlds that orbit distant stars.  

You don't have to be a rocket scientist or an astrophysicist to actively participate in studying distant worlds. We’ll teach you what you need to know to become a citizen scientist collecting important data on exoplanets. No telescope? No problem! You can use our data checkout system to request data from an exoplanet observation to analyze yourself.  

## As of August 2023, Exoplanet Watch participants have studied over 350 different exoplanets, and created over 2500 light curves.  

When planets orbiting in other solar systems pass in front of their stars, the star looks a little bit dimmer to us. This passage is called a transit, and the graph of that dip in brightness is called a light curve. This dimming of the star's light is too small to see with our eyes, but when we have a computer compare a star's brightness over time, it can detect the small changes in brightness during the exoplanet's transit.  

Exoplanet Watch lets you turn a series of photographs of a star during an exoplanet transit into a light curve using free software called EXOTIC. Light curves help astronomers learn more about exoplanets. As a citizen scientist, you can learn about exoplanets and study them, too.  

With your help, Exoplanet Watch will:  

- Make the best use of larger telescopes — more accurately predict the next transit event for follow-up with space-based telescopes (e.g., the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope) or large ground-based telescopes  
- Discover new exoplanets — using transit timing variations to infer the existence of an additional exoplanet in a extrasolar system  
- Monitor stellar variability — changes in a star's brightness caused by spots (dark regions) and plages (bright regions) of an exoplanet's host star can be measured  

As an Exoplanet Watch citizen scientist, you will:  

Learn how science is done from beginning to end, collecting data, processing it, sharing it, and reading papers that incorporate it  
Observe transiting exoplanets (if you have a telescope), or request data from other people's telescopes (if you do not) using our data checkout system  
Reduce and analyze your data, using our free EXOTIC software, to create your own transiting exoplanet light curves  
Upload your results to the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) Exoplanet Database  
Have your light curve included on the Exoplanet Watch's Results webpage  
If your observations or light curves are used in a scientific paper, your name will be listed as a co-author on the paper, and you will get credit for participating in scientific research  
Meet astronomers who study exoplanets professionally and collaborate with other citizen scientists in our bi-weekly meetings and on our Slack  
Sounds great! How do I participate?
